For this assignment, I used a very simple html file with only 20 lines of code,
utilizing almost all javascript to create the quiz. This assignment is made up
of the index.html file, which contains the quiz, Scorepage.html, which is the
home of the highscore page, along with css files for both and the script.js page.
The quiz loops through the questions and choices list in the question object,
updating your score and timer through each repitition. Once the quiz is finished, 
the user is asked for their name, which is saved along with their score into the
user object. This object is saved to local storage, and then you're redirected 
to the Scorepage.html file. The Scorepage pulls down the user info from local 
storage and then displays it on the page. The user is given buttons to jump
between the quiz, high score page, and to clear the high scores.
